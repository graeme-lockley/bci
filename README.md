# bci

This project is an implementation of a byte code interpreter.  The byte code has the following characteristics:

- Values are typed - boolean, 8-bit character, signed 32 bit integer, float, string, pointer and closure
- Two stacks - a frame stack and calculation stack

This byte code interpreter is helpful for running code for a typed language.
